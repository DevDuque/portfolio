      "My work at EasyMarket focused on improving design and user experience (UI and UX). <br /> Project developed by my colleagues at COLTEC. <br /> <br /> EasyMarket aims to make daily shopping more practical and organized. <br />The app allows users to create shopping lists, view nearby supermarkets, track their spending history, and even consult an API to search for food items and view the calories of each item based on a specific weight, helping users make more informed food choices.",

      "In the WTB project, I worked end-to-end, developing both the UI and UX as well as the application itself. Additionally, I took the initiative as a leader, organizing and distributing tasks among my colleagues.<br /> <br /> WTB is an app that combines cinema and music, creating an immersive experience where image and sound complement each other. The concept is to explore how music enhances emotions in films, offering a new way to experience them. <br /> <br /> Initially, we planned to use the TMDB API, but due to technical difficulties, we decided to create a list of movies stored in memory, saved in the database, and linked to the user. <br />The app displays movies in a simple list, allowing the logged-in user to add their favorites, ensuring a personalized experience aligned with the original concept: offering the perfect harmony between cinema and music.",
